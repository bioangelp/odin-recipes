    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until well combined.</li>
        <li>Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Press two chocolate candies into each dough ball to create the spider's eyes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once the cookies are completely cooled, use melted chocolate to attach eight pretzel sticks to each cookie to create the spider's legs.</li>
        <li>Allow the chocolate to set before serving, and enjoy these deliciously creepy spider cookies!</li>
